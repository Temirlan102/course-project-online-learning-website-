standing here
I realize
You are just like me,
Trying to make a history

But who is to judge, 
The right from wrong,
When our guard is down
I think we’ll both agree

That violence breeds violence
But in the end it has to be this way
I’ve carved my own path
You followed your wrath
But maybe we’re both the same
